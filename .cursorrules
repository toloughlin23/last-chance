# Cursor Guardrails: Zero-Contamination Policy

golden_rules:
  - "Never introduce mocks, placeholders, lorem ipsum, fake endpoints, dummy data, or stubs."
  - "Prefer real integrations over fakes. If integration is unavailable, leave the code unimplemented rather than adding fake data."
  - "Do not generate example configs or fake files."
  - "Preserve and improve functionality; prefer non-destructive edits."

banned_patterns:
  - "lorem ipsum"
  - "mock data"
  - "dummy data"
  - "fake data"
  - "placeholder"
  - "stubbed"
  - "REPLACE_ME"
  - "CHANGEME"
  - "YOUR_API_KEY"
  - "example.com/api"

allowed_exceptions:
  - "Explicit allow on a single line using comment token: nocontam: allow <reason>"

notes:
  - "This file documents expectations for AI-assisted edits in Cursor. Enforcement is backed by pre-commit + CI."
